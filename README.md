# ü™®üìÑ‚úÇÔ∏è Real-Time Rock Paper Scissors Game with YOLOv8

This project implements a real-time Rock-Paper-Scissors game using **YOLOv8** for hand gesture detection. The game runs in Google Colab and utilizes a webcam for player input.

## How to Play
1. Both players must start by showing "Rock".
2. Move your hands for 3 seconds. If a player does not move their hand within this time, they lose 1 point.
3. Show your move (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
4. YOLOv8 detects the moves and determines the winner.
5. Bounding boxes are drawn around detected moves for visualization.

## Running the Game in Google Colab
1. Open [this Colab notebook](https://github.com/RozhanMk/Real-time-rock-paper-scissor/blob/master/RPS-webcam-Yolo8-colab.ipynb).
2. Replace the `API_KEY` with your own from Roboflow.
3. Run all cells to start the game.
4. Allow camera access in Google Colab.

## Dataset
- The [dataset](https://app.roboflow.com/reyhane2525/final-v2-kpqgq) was created using Roboflow.
- It contains labeled images of hands showing Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
- The dataset was made with the help of many students from Shahid Beheshti University (*I don't take that university seriously, but their computer engineering students are quite helpful!*).
- To use the dataset, **you must generate your API key** from Roboflow and replace it in the notebook.

## Bonus point
-  For anyone interested, the notebook for detecting Rock Paper Scissors using mediapipe library is added to this repository.
